# Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation
It implements traffic lights into a traffic simulation of vehicles driving on streets and turning on intersections. The first car arriving at an intersection will be allowed to enter it and advance, but only if the traffic light is green. If it is not, the car has to wait for the event to happen.
